# Pribaikalsky National Park: Ecological & Social Conservation Analysis

### 1. Project Overview
Solved the challenge of synthesizing multi-disciplinary data (geological, biological, and socio-political) to assess the conservation health of the Pribaikalsky National Park and Lake Baikal, the world’s deepest freshwater ecosystem.

### 2. Dataset
Sourced and analyzed diverse environmental data, including:
* **Climate Data:** 40+ years of surface water temperature trends in the Southern Basin.
* **Nutrient Metrics:** Seasonal nitrate ($NO_{3}^{-}$), phosphate (SRP), and chlorophyll-a concentrations.
* **Geospatial Data:** Mapping of the 417,000-hectare protected area via OpenStreetMap and UNESCO records.
* **Policy Archives:** Historical records of the Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Mill and the 1986 Park Establishment Act.

### 3. Approach
* **Socio-Ecological Mapping:** Categorized the evolution of the park from its 1986 founding tensions to the modern-day "Overtourism" crisis of the 2020s.
* **Environmental Impact Analysis:** Analyzed how a $0.20 R^{2}$ warming trend in surface water temperatures is stressing endemic cold-water species like the Baikal Seal.
* **Visual Communication:** Developed a "Parkscape Report" and "Timeline Poster" to translate complex geological timelines (25M years) into digestible stakeholder insights.

### 4. Results
* **Metrics:** Identified measurable shifts in the littoral zone's nutrient regime, indicating a transition from strictly oligotrophic to human-impacted states.
* **Insights:** Discovered that local "social friction" (fishing/land-use restrictions) is increasingly overshadowed by "global stressors" like climate change and unregulated guesthouses.
* **Visuals:** Produced detailed seasonal graphs showing the correlation between human activity (tourism spikes) and algal biomass growth.

### 5. Key Learnings
This project taught me the importance of **Systems Thinking** in data analysis. I learned that you cannot analyze environmental metrics (like nitrate levels) without understanding the underlying social context (tourism policy and local governance). By synthesizing data from geological reports, climate studies, and legal frameworks, I mastered the ability to create a "360-degree" view of a complex problem, a skill directly applicable to analyzing large-scale business or technical ecosystems.
